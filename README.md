# Decimal-To-128-bit-Floating-Point-Converter
This is a floating-point converter that takes decimal inputs and gives the floating point and hexadecimal outputs based on the 2019 edition of IEEE-754.

Currently, it supports single, double, and quadruple precision outputs, with their respective special cases.
Additionally, it supports both binary and decimal floating point representations, which the user can freely choose from, as well as Truncation, Ceiling, Floor, and RtN-E rounding methods.

For the binary floating point, please note that it does not support string inputs and NaN.

The application can be accessed through index.html if downloaded, but can also be accessed through this link:
